# User Manager
My initial project involved utilizing HTML and  CSS on the front end, complemented by Python and Flask on the back end, all seamlessly integrated with a MySQL database. This endeavor comprised distinct code files such as app.py, Login.html, Signup.html. Forgotpassword.html, and Welcome.html, each designed as an HTML file styled with Style, CSS. Furthermore, simple Javascript codes were employed to enhance specific features within the project.

## Installation and Usage
for running Python code files you need to have or install some libraries such as "Flask", "MySQL.connector", "os", "random", "string" and, "werkzeug.security" in your Python packages.
in the next step, you should have a Server or create a local with apps like [XAMPP](https://www.apachefriends.org/). After installation you open the XAMMP, click on start in front of MySQL, and turn it on. now you should create a MySQL database, The Database Should have 4 columns: First_name, Lastname, Email, and Password, and finally, insert its information into your Python file such blow:
```python
db_config = {
    'host': 'your hostname',
    'user': 'you host user name',
    'password': 'your host password',
    'database': 'your database name'
}
```
Directories should be like default directories and files in the correct directories like default. now You first run app.py and after that, you can run each of the HTML files.

## Roadmap
this was a simple project or better to say a basis for a website's user management section and by adding some features like an admin section and edit Profile ability for users it can be a complete user management project.
